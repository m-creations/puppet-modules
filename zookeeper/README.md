[![Puppet
Forge](http://img.shields.io/puppetforge/v/deric/zookeeper.svg)](https://forge.puppetlabs.com/deric/zookeeper) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/deric/puppet-zookeeper.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/deric/puppet-zookeeper)

A puppet receipt for [Apache Zookeeper](http://zookeeper.apache.org/). ZooKeeper is a high-performance coordination service for maintaining configuration information, naming, providing distributed synchronization, and providing group services.

## Requirements

  * Puppet 2.7, Puppet 3.x
  * Ruby 1.8.7, 1.9.3, 2.0.0, 2.1.x
  * binary package of ZooKeeper

## Basic Usage:

```puppet
class { 'zookeeper': }
```

If `$::ipaddress` is not your public IP (e.g. you are using Docker) make sure to setup correct IP:

```puppet
class { 'zookeeper':
  client_ip => $::ipaddress_eth0
}
```

or in Hiera:

```yaml
zookeeper::client_ip: "%{::ipaddress_eth0}"
```

##  Parameters

   - `id` - cluster-unique zookeeper's instance id (1-255)
   - `datastore`
   - `log_dir`
   - `purge_interval` - automatically will delete zookeeper logs (available since 3.4.0)
   - `snap_retain_count` - number of snapshots that will be kept after purging (since 3.4.0)

and many others, see the `init.pp` file for more details.

If your distribution has multiple packages for ZooKeeper, you can provide all package names
as an array.

```puppet
class { 'zookeeper':
  packages => ['zookeeper', 'zookeeper-java']
}
```

## Hiera Support

All parameters could be defined in hiera files, e.g. `common.yaml`, `Debian.yaml` or `zookeeper.yaml`:

```yaml
zookeeper::id: 1
zookeeper::client_port: 2181
zookeeper::datastore: '/var/lib/zookeeper'
```

## Cloudera package

In Cloudera distribution ZooKeeper package is called `zookeeper-server` and the service as well. Moreover
there's initialization script which should be called after installation.

```puppet
class { 'zookeeper':
  packages             => ['zookeeper-server'],
  service_name         => 'zookeeper-server',
  initialize_datastore => true
}
```
